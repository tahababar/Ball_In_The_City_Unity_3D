I created a 3D Unity game. The player controls a spherical ball and is responsible for collecting all the coins in the arena in the least possible time. The intention behind this project was to prepare a learning experience for other students so they can learn the basics and advanced features of game development and can create Unity 3D games on their own. To do this, I created this game and then wrote its documentation.
